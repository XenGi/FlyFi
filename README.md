Floppy-Fidelity

In order to get this running you need the following stuff:

* python-serial
* python-pyside


On Debian, Ubuntu and maybe other Linux distributions you need to update PySerial to a newer version.
You can get it with these commands on Ubuntu or Debian:

apt-get install python-pip
pip install pyserial --upgrade
